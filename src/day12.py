# this was a bloody fun ride. For some reason I started some "Dynamic Programming" shenanigans which - of course - led
# me nowhere. Then I managed to get someone suggesting Djikstra. Of course, it was the right suggestion, but took me
# quite a while to nail it.
# The reality is that the first idea I had was on the good track - I needed to track the visited places and make sure I
# never circled back to my steps.
# The Djikstra here doesn't build the Vertex-edges matrix, but builds it "dynamically" by using the neighbouring rule,
# adding the fact that the neighbour can be visited only if it hasn't alread (removing from the cost matrix does exactly
# that - we visited the position, added cost to all neighbours thus no other step can come back.
# Fun part the second one: I didn't notice there were (of course) spots which could not reach the top (predictable,
# though); initializing the cost to an impossible value made me add an extra condition to signal that.
# The current result is slow, as walk is called once per starting point. Once I have a set of parents, though, ideally
# I can start finding paths for every element in the possible_starts and remove them if found.
