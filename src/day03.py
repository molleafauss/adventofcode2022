# the first half of the line was put in a set only for helping with the second part of the puzzle where set.intersection
# was practically the solution to the puzzle.
# The first part was probably fine using "letter in line"; with the size of inputs, lookup in a set vs going through
# a sequence would have no perceivable difference in performance.
#
# score formulas for the letters according to the puzzle.
# uppercase letter: ord(ch) - 'A' + 27
UPPER = 27 - ord('A')
# uppercase letter: ord(ch) - 'a' + 1
LOWER = 1 - ord('a')
